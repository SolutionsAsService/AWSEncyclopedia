      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Amazon IAM (Identity and Access Management) allows users to securely access and manage AWS resources. To achieve complete control over access to AWS tools and resources, IAM provides centralized management for authentication (who signs in) and authorization (what permissions they have). Its attribute-based access control enables you to create and enforce policies based on user attributes such as job role, department, etc. This empowers you to allow or deny access based on precise criteria, ensuring that the right individuals have the right permissions at the right time.
