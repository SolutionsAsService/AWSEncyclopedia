      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Amazon S3 is an object storage service known for its scalability, durability, and high availability. It enables you to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, making it ideal for backup, archival, content distribution, and big data analytics.
      </p>

    <!-- How to Use Section -->
    <section id="how-to-use">
      <h2>How to Use Amazon S3</h2>
      <p>
        Using Amazon S3 is straightforward and versatile. Here are the key steps and features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bucket Creation:</strong> Start by creating buckets which act as containers for your objects. Buckets can be set up with specific regions, access policies, and lifecycle configurations.</li>
        <li><strong>Uploading Objects:</strong> Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs to upload objects. You can perform multi-part uploads for larger files and enable versioning to keep track of changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Secure your data by configuring bucket policies, Access Control Lists (ACLs), and Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to define who can access your resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Seamlessly integrate S3 with other AWS services like CloudFront for content delivery, Lambda for event-driven processing, and Glacier for long-term archival storage.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Pros & Cons Section -->
    <section id="pros-cons">
      <h2>Pros &amp; Cons</h2>
      <div class="pros">
        <h3>Pros</h3>
