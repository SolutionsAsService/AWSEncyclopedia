      <p>
        Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is a managed database service provided by AWS, designed to simplify the process of setting up, operating, and scaling relational databases in the cloud. It supports various database engines such as PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and more.
