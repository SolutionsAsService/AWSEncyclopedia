      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Amazon Lambda is a serverless and event-driven computing service that enables you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales your applications by running code in response to triggers such as changes in data, system state, or user actions. With Lambda, you only pay for the compute time you consume, making it a cost-effective option for running backend services and virtual applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        By eliminating the need to worry about server management, developers can focus solely on writing code. Lambda’s robust architecture ensures precise software scaling and extensive availability, capable of handling hundreds to thousands of workloads per second.
